# Video Streaming Content-Length Fix Summary

## Problem Description
The server was experiencing critical video streaming errors:
```
RuntimeError: Response content longer than Content-Length
```

This error occurred repeatedly when trying to stream video files, causing video playback to fail completely.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in the `serve_video_file()` function in `core/client.py`:

1. **Content-Length Mismatch**: The server was setting `Content-Length` headers for range requests (HTTP 206) but the `FileResponse` was still trying to stream the entire file
2. **Improper Range Handling**: Range requests were not being handled correctly, leading to content length mismatches
3. **Missing Cleanup**: File connections were not being properly cleaned up after streaming

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Replaced FileResponse with StreamingResponse
- **Before**: Used `FileResponse` which caused Content-Length conflicts
- **After**: Used `StreamingResponse` with custom generators for precise control

### 2. Custom Range Request Handler
```python
async def range_response_generator():
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
            f.seek(start)
            remaining = content_length
            chunk_size = 8192  # 8KB chunks
            
            while remaining > 0:
                read_size = min(chunk_size, remaining)
                chunk = f.read(read_size)
                if not chunk:
                    break
                yield chunk
                remaining -= len(chunk)
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error in range response generator: {e}")
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail="Error reading file")
    finally:
        # Cleanup when streaming is complete
        unregister_file_connection(filename)
```

### 3. Custom Full File Generator
```python
async def full_file_generator_with_cleanup():
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
            chunk_size = 8192  # 8KB chunks
            while True:
                chunk = f.read(chunk_size)
                if not chunk:
                    break
                yield chunk
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error in full file generator: {e}")
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail="Error reading file")
    finally:
        # Cleanup when streaming is complete
        unregister_file_connection(filename)
```

### 4. Proper HTTP Status Codes
- **Range Requests**: HTTP 206 (Partial Content) with accurate `Content-Length`
- **Full Requests**: HTTP 200 with streaming response

### 5. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added proper exception handling in generators
- Implemented cleanup in `finally` blocks
- Added detailed error logging

## Technical Benefits

### Before Fix:
- ❌ `RuntimeError: Response content longer than Content-Length`
- ❌ Videos failed to load completely
- ❌ Multiple server crashes
- ❌ Poor user experience

### After Fix:
- ✅ Videos stream properly without errors
- ✅ Range requests work correctly for seeking
- ✅ Proper cleanup of file connections
- ✅ Smooth video playback experience
- ✅ No server crashes from video streaming

## Files Modified

### `core/client.py`
- Added `StreamingResponse` import
- Replaced `FileResponse` with `StreamingResponse`
- Implemented custom generators for range and full file requests
- Added proper cleanup mechanisms
- Enhanced error handling

## Testing Results

The fix has been successfully tested and shows:
- ✅ Video loading started
- ✅ Video metadata loaded
- ✅ Video data loaded  
- ✅ Video can play
- ✅ Video can play through
- ✅ No Content-Length errors in server logs

## Browser Extension Errors (Unrelated)

The JavaScript errors shown in the logs:
```
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'querySelector')
```

These are from a Chrome browser extension (`contentscript.js`) and are **not related** to your application. They don't affect video streaming functionality.

## Security Features Maintained

All security features remain intact:
- ✅ Directory traversal protection
- ✅ File extension validation
- ✅ Content-Type headers
- ✅ Security headers applied
- ✅ No automatic downloads
- ✅ Streaming-only access

## Performance Improvements

- **Memory Usage**: Reduced memory footprint with streaming
- **Start Time**: Faster video start times
- **Network Efficiency**: Better bandwidth utilization
- **Error Recovery**: Proper cleanup prevents resource leaks

## Conclusion

The video streaming Content-Length issue has been completely resolved. Videos now stream properly without any server errors, providing a smooth user experience for video playback in the security camera system.

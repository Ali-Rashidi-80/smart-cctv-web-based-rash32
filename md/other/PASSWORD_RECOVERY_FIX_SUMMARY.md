# Password Recovery System Fix Summary

## Problem Description
The original password recovery system had a critical flaw: users could request a recovery code via SMS, but there was no UI in the login page to enter that code and actually reset their password. The system only sent the SMS but provided no way to complete the password reset process.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Login Page UI (`templates/login.html`)

#### Two-Step Recovery Process
- **Step 1**: Send recovery code via SMS
  - Phone number input with validation
  - CAPTCHA verification
  - "ارسال کد بازیابی" (Send Recovery Code) button

- **Step 2**: Enter recovery code and new password
  - 6-digit recovery code input (numeric only)
  - New password input with strength validation
  - Confirm password input
  - "تغییر رمز عبور" (Change Password) button
  - "بازگشت به مرحله قبل" (Back to Previous Step) button

#### Key Features Added
- **Numeric-only recovery code input** with real-time validation
- **Password strength meter** for the new password
- **Form validation** for all inputs
- **Loading states** with spinners
- **Error handling** with Persian messages
- **Responsive design** that works on mobile and desktop

### 2. Backend API Improvements (`server_fastapi.py`)

#### New Request Model
```python
class PasswordResetRequest(BaseModel):
    code: str = Field(..., min_length=6, max_length=6)
    new_password: str = Field(..., min_length=8, max_length=100)
```

#### Enhanced Reset Password Endpoint
- **JSON request handling** instead of query parameters
- **Input validation** for code format and password strength
- **Security improvements** with proper sanitization
- **Better error messages** in Persian

#### Validation Features
- Recovery code must be exactly 6 digits
- New password must be at least 8 characters
- Password strength validation
- Rate limiting protection
- Token expiration checking

### 3. JavaScript Enhancements

#### Form Management
- **Dynamic form switching** between recovery steps
- **Form reset functionality** when switching tabs
- **Input validation** with real-time feedback
- **Loading state management**

#### Security Features
- **Numeric-only input** for recovery codes
- **Password strength calculation** and display
- **CAPTCHA regeneration** for security
- **Input sanitization** and validation

#### User Experience
- **Smooth transitions** between steps
- **Clear error messages** in Persian
- **Success feedback** with automatic redirect
- **Back button functionality** to return to step 1

## Technical Implementation Details

### Frontend Changes
1. **HTML Structure**: Added two-step recovery form with proper IDs and classes
2. **CSS Styling**: Maintained consistent design with existing login page
3. **JavaScript Logic**: 
   - Form submission handlers for both steps
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Dynamic UI state management
   - Error handling and user feedback

### Backend Changes
1. **Request Model**: New `PasswordResetRequest` model for JSON handling
2. **Endpoint Update**: Modified `/reset-password` to accept JSON requests
3. **Validation**: Enhanced input validation and error handling
4. **Security**: Improved sanitization and rate limiting

### Database Integration
- Uses existing `password_recovery` table
- Proper token validation and expiration checking
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt
- Audit logging for security events

## Security Features

### Input Validation
- Phone number format validation (Iranian numbers)
- Recovery code format validation (6 digits)
- Password strength requirements
- CAPTCHA verification

### Rate Limiting
- Request rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Login attempt tracking
- SMS sending limits

### Data Protection
- Input sanitization to prevent injection attacks
- Secure password hashing
- Token expiration (24 hours)
- One-time use tokens

## User Flow

1. **User clicks "بازیابی" (Recovery) tab**
2. **Step 1**: User enters phone number and CAPTCHA
3. **System sends SMS** with 6-digit recovery code
4. **UI switches to Step 2** automatically
5. **User enters recovery code** and new password
6. **System validates** and updates password
7. **Success message** and redirect to login

## Testing

### Comprehensive Test Suite
- **Login page accessibility** test
- **Form element presence** verification
- **API endpoint functionality** testing
- **Input validation** testing
- **Error handling** verification

### Test Results
```
✅ Login Page Access: PASS
✅ Recovery Functionality: PASS
✅ Form Validation: PASS
✅ API Endpoints: PASS
✅ Security Features: PASS
```

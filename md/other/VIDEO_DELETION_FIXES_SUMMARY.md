# Video Deletion Fixes Summary

## Problems Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Missing WebSocket Handler for Video Deletion**
- **Problem**: Server was sending `video_deleted` WebSocket messages but client had no handler
- **Fix**: Added `handleVideoDeleted()` function to process WebSocket deletion notifications
- **Location**: `static/js/index/script.js` - `handleWebSocketMessage()` function

### 2. **Duplicate Delete Requests**
- **Problem**: Multiple delete requests were being sent for the same video, causing 302 redirects
- **Root Cause**: Authentication failures (401) were being converted to 302 redirects by frontend
- **Fix**: 
  - Added `deletingVideos` Set to track videos being deleted
  - Prevent duplicate deletion requests
  - Improved error handling to prevent redirects on 401 responses

### 3. **Modal Not Closing Automatically**
- **Problem**: Video player modal stayed open after video deletion
- **Fix**: 
  - Added `closeModalsForVideo()` function to close all relevant modals
  - Updated modal state management
  - Ensure modals close immediately when video is deleted

### 4. **Repeated Confirmation Requests**
- **Problem**: System asked for confirmation multiple times for the same video
- **Fix**: 
  - Added button state management (disable during deletion)
  - Prevent multiple confirmations for videos already being deleted
  - Added visual feedback (opacity change) during deletion process

### 5. **Authentication Error Handling**
- **Problem**: 401 responses caused redirects instead of proper error handling
- **Fix**: 
  - Custom error handling for 401 responses in `deleteVideo()` function
  - Prevent automatic redirects on authentication failures
  - Show user-friendly error messages

- Prevention of multiple clicks

### Data Structures Added

#### `deletingVideos` Set

- Ensures proper cleanup after deletion

## Code Changes Summary

### 1. Constructor Enhancement
```javascript
this.deletingVideos = new Set(); // Track videos being deleted to prevent duplicates
```

### 2. WebSocket Message Handler
```javascript
case 'video_deleted':
    this.handleVideoDeleted(data);
    break;
```

### 3. Delete Button State Management

deleteBtn.disabled = true;
deleteBtn.style.opacity = '0.6';
```

### 4. Authentication Error Handling
```javascript
if (response.status === 401) {
    // Authentication failed - don't redirect, just show error
    throw new Error('Authentication failed. Please refresh the page and try again.');
}
```

### 5. Modal State Management
```javascript
// Update modal state
this.modalState.isOpen = false;
this.modalState.currentVideo = null;
```

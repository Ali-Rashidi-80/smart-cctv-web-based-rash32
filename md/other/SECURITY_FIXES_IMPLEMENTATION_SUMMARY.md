- ‚úÖ Added `check_api_rate_limit()` function

### 5. Enhanced Password Validation
- ‚úÖ Updated `RegisterRequest` model with password strength validation
- ‚úÖ Updated `PasswordResetRequest` model with enhanced validation
- ‚úÖ Password requirements: 12+ chars, 3 of: uppercase, lowercase, digits, special chars

### 6. Enhanced File Upload Validation
- ‚úÖ Updated `upload_photo` endpoint with strict file validation
- ‚úÖ Updated `upload_frame` endpoint with enhanced validation
- ‚úÖ Added filename and content-type validation

### 7. Enhanced Parameter Validation
- ‚úÖ Updated `set_servo` endpoint with `validate_parameter_range()` function
- ‚úÖ Improved validation for servo1, servo2 parameters

### 8. Enhanced Path Traversal Protection
- ‚úÖ Updated `/gallery/{filename}` endpoint with enhanced protection
- ‚úÖ Updated `/security_videos/{filename}` endpoint with enhanced protection
- ‚úÖ Added `sanitize_filename()` function usage
- ‚úÖ Added additional path traversal pattern checks

### 9. Enhanced Exception Handling
- ‚úÖ Added global exception handler to prevent information disclosure
- ‚úÖ Added HTTP exception handler with security headers
- ‚úÖ Improved error handling to avoid stack trace exposure

## ‚ùå Issues Still Present

### 1. Security Headers Not Applied
**Problem**: Security headers are not being applied to all responses
**Root Cause**: Middleware is not consistently applying headers to all response types
**Status**: Partially implemented but not working correctly

### 2. Authentication Bypass
**Problem**: Protected endpoints are still accessible without authentication
**Root Cause**: Middleware authentication logic may not be working correctly
**Status**: Needs investigation and fix

### 3. Rate Limiting Not Working
**Problem**: Rate limiting is not being enforced
**Root Cause**: Rate limiting functions may not be called correctly
**Status**: Needs implementation verification

### 4. File Upload Validation Issues
**Problem**: Malicious files are still being accepted
**Root Cause**: File validation may not be strict enough or not being called
**Status**: Partially implemented but needs verification

### 5. Parameter Validation Issues
**Problem**: Invalid parameters are still being accepted
**Root Cause**: Validation functions may not be called or may have issues
**Status**: Partially implemented but needs verification

### 6. Path Traversal Still Working
**Problem**: Path traversal attacks are still successful
**Root Cause**: Protection may not be comprehensive enough
**Status**: Partially implemented but needs verification

### 7. WebSocket Authentication Issues
**Problem**: WebSocket connections are accepted without authentication
**Root Cause**: Authentication logic may not be working correctly
**Status**: Needs investigation and fix

### 8. CSRF Protection Missing
**Problem**: CSRF protection is not implemented
**Root Cause**: CSRF tokens are not being generated or validated
**Status**: Functions created but not integrated

## üîß Next Steps Required

### 1. Fix Middleware Issues
- Investigate why security headers are not being applied consistently
- Fix authentication bypass issues in middleware
- Ensure rate limiting is properly enforced

### 2. Verify Function Integration
- Ensure all security functions are being called correctly
- Test file upload validation thoroughly
- Verify parameter validation is working

### 3. Implement CSRF Protection
- Integrate CSRF token generation and validation
- Add CSRF tokens to forms and API endpoints
- Test CSRF protection thoroughly

### 4. Fix WebSocket Authentication
- Investigate WebSocket authentication issues
- Ensure proper token validation for WebSocket connections
- Test WebSocket security thoroughly

### 5. Comprehensive Testing
- Run security tests after each fix
- Verify all vulnerabilities are addressed
- Test edge cases and attack scenarios

## üìä Current Status
- **Total Security Measures**: 35
- **Successfully Applied**: 3 (8.6%)
- **Failed**: 32 (91.4%)
- **Skipped**: 0

## üéØ Priority Actions
1. **High Priority**: Fix middleware security header application
2. **High Priority**: Fix authentication bypass issues
3. **Medium Priority**: Implement CSRF protection
4. **Medium Priority**: Fix rate limiting enforcement
5. **Low Priority**: Verify and test all implemented functions

## üìù Notes
- Most security functions have been implemented but are not being used correctly
- The main issue appears to be in the middleware and function integration
- Need to systematically test each security measure after implementation
- Consider restarting the server after each major fix to ensure changes take effect

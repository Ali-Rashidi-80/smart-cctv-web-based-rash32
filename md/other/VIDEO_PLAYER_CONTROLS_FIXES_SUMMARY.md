# Video Player Controls Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Controls Not Working in Modal Mode
**Problem**: Video player controls (play/pause, volume, progress bar) only worked in fullscreen mode and were non-functional inside the modal.

**Root Cause**: 
- Controls had low z-index (20) which was being blocked by modal layers
- Event propagation was being interrupted by modal event handlers
- Controls were not properly initialized for modal context

**Solution**:
- Increased z-index to 1000 for controls
- Added proper event handling with `preventDefault()` and `stopPropagation()`
- Implemented modal-specific control activation/deactivation
- Added `ensureModalControlsAccessibility()` method

### 2. Reversed Left/Right Arrow Controls
**Problem**: Left and right arrow keys were working in reverse direction due to RTL (right-to-left) language support.

**Root Cause**: 
- Arrow key handling didn't account for RTL language direction
- Left arrow was always going backward, right arrow always forward

**Solution**:
- Added RTL language detection (`document.documentElement.dir === 'rtl'` or `lang-fa` class)
- For RTL languages (Persian):
  - Left arrow (←) now goes forward (+10 seconds)
  - Right arrow (→) now goes backward (-10 seconds)
- For LTR languages (English):
  - Left arrow (←) goes backward (-10 seconds)  
  - Right arrow (→) goes forward (+10 seconds)

## Technical Changes Made

### JavaScript (video-player.js)
1. **Enhanced Event Handling**:
   - Added proper event prevention and propagation control
   - Improved control button event binding
   - Added modal context detection for keyboard shortcuts

2. **Modal Controls Management**:
   - `ensureModalControlsAccessibility()` method
   - `activateModalControls()` method  
   - `deactivateModalControls()` method

3. **RTL Language Support**:
   - Fixed arrow key direction logic
   - Added language detection for proper control mapping

### CSS (styles.css)
1. **Control Visibility**:
   - Increased z-index to 1000
   - Added `!important` rules for modal controls
   - Enhanced control button styling for modal context

2. **Responsive Design**:
   - Added mobile-specific styles
   - Improved control button sizing
   - Enhanced progress bar visibility

3. **Modal-Specific Styling**:
   - Force controls to always be visible in modal
   - Improved button prominence and hover effects
   - Better progress bar styling

## Testing Recommendations
1. **Modal Controls**: Test all control buttons (play/pause, volume, fullscreen) in modal mode
2. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Test arrow keys for both RTL and LTR language modes
3. **Progress Bar**: Test clicking and dragging on progress bar in modal
4. **Volume Control**: Test volume slider functionality in modal
5. **Responsive**: Test on different screen sizes and devices
